# Magic Eight Ball (Xamarin.Forms)

This code is a complete implementation of the [Evolve 2014 mini-hack](https://github.com/xamarin/mini-hacks/tree/master/Xamarin.Forms), and was also shown in my talk [Your First Xamarin.Forms App](http://www.slideshare.net/conceptdev/your-first-xamarinforms-app).

For a much more awesome implmentation, check out Glenn's version [Xam8Ball](https://github.com/glennstephens/Xam8Ball) which looks a lot cooler!
